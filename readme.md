# Community Agreements

## **Cultivate a brave space**

We cannot guarantee safety, but we can strive for a space where we share bravely, take risks, be vulnerable and hold each accountable with love and respect.

1. No one knows everything; everyone knows something; together we know a lot. We
are all learners and have different life experiences; we can all learn
from each other without canceling anyone.
2. We can’t be eloquent all the time.

From @Tina Deng:
We all have different backgrounds and different levels of knowledge of different things. It is very lucky to be in diversified community like this.

## **Be respectful**

Of your own feelings and those of others, as well as of all races, cultures, sexual orientations, gender identities, religions, class backgrounds, abilities, body sizes and perspectives when speaking.

From @Tina Deng:
When listening to others, try to think at their points. Being understanding and sympathying for others is very important.

## **Recognize your own and others’ privilege**

When entering a space, when speaking or not speaking be aware of privilege based on many forms of identity. At the same time, **don’t assume the identity** of others.

## **Honor confidentiality**

What we share stays here. If you tell stories about this time, ask permission first, or if nothing too personal remove identifying information.

- Administrators have some limitations related to university guidelines

## **Share from your own experiences**

Your perspective is shaped by your tradition, beliefs, identities and life experiences. Speak from your heart using “I” statements to take ownership of what you say. The only person you can truly speak for is yourself.

From @Jiyoon Moon:

I would love to hear from everyone's personal experiences especially since we all come from such different backgrounds.

## **Honor silence and time for reflection**

This also allows time for others to move up their speaking. Practice waiting: W.A.I.T. – why am I talking?

## **Practice active listening**

Try to listen without judgment, with the intent of understanding the speaker. Listen to understand, not to respond. As soon as you’re thinking “That’s good.” or “I don’t like that” or you’re planning how
you’re going to respond, you are having a conversation in your mind and not listening to the speaker.

## **Agree to disagree… but don’t disengage**

Listen with the intent of understanding, not to agree or to believe what is being said. Your presence adds value to our group process. You do not have to agree or believe anything shared; your job is to listen for understanding. **Disagree with the statement, not the person** if you must disagree.  ****

## **Acknowledge intent, address impact**

We may not mean to cause harm, but it can happen anyway. When someone is hurt we first attend to the hurt person, and then can process why and how the hurt happened and how to prevent it in the future while maintaining active group engagement.

## **Acknowledge the liveliness of language**

As an example, “you guys” may be intended as gender neutral but may not be received as such; the term “queer” can be offensive to one person and essential for another.

## **Move up, move up**

If you usually don’t share much, challenge yourself to share more; if you find yourself sharing more than others, challenge yourself to listen more.

## **Suspend status**

We are all partners in our quest for insight and understanding, and we each have different areas of expertise.

## **Lean into discomfort**

Where you’re challenged is where you have space to learn.

> Expect and accept non-closure. There is often no easy solution, and we can expect to remain in uncertainty and with the need to continue to dialogue and explore.

## **Stay present; take care of yourself**

Truly engaging can be challenging and vulnerable. 

From @Taylor Paydos: 

Sometimes showing up to class is the best you can do mentally, don't push yourself if its putting your own health at risk.

From @Aldora Wang:

1. Try not to be late for class, and be prepared. But health first.
2. When you know that you will be absent, let the professor or your friends in class know.
3. Be open and mindful. Think before you say.

From @Simone Sun:

We are a community of, and in solidarity with, people from every gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, and background. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs.

## Tips

- We are not code snobs.
- We listen to each other.
- We keep our community respectful and open.
- We work together and help each other out when it’s within our capacity.
- We recognize that people learn in different ways, therefore we don’t judge when someone asks a question.

From @Isaac Sante:

## **Write clean code**

It's good for you and good for other and makes eveyones life better.
Also uses less data thus less energy usage thus saving the planet.

## **Believe in yourself**

Although you may be experiencing technical problems you can always surpass them with enough perseverance.

From @Taylor Paydos:

## **Be open to collaboration**

Cooperation with other classmates is key and gives you the opportunity to learn from other points of view. Helps to strengthen your own and others work.

From @Anshuman Uchil:

## **Have Fun**

Make sure to enjoy what you make, what you learn and what you share.

## **Be understanding of Time zones and Schedules**

Understand the different time zones your peers are in.

From @Tina Deng:
We are located in different locations with different time zones and different part of the day. I had never had a class that started at 11 PM, and it really is challenging for me because my brain literally stops working at late night.
